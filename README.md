This is NOT a period tracker, because women's health is so much more than just a menstrual cycle

Vita â€“ Womenâ€™s Health Platform

Vita is a womenâ€™s health platform designed to create a safe, supportive space where women can share their health challenges and connect with others who truly understand. Too often, medical research has centred on men, leaving women misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and underserved. Vita aims to close that gap by combining community support with reliable, women-specific health information, helping users learn, advocate for themselves, and feel empowered on their journey to better health.

ðŸŒ¸ Purpose

Womenâ€™s health data has historically been underrepresented in clinical studies:

Only 38% of clinical studies report data by sex.

Less than 23% discuss sex-specific results.

Women under 55 having a heart attack are 7Ã— more likely to be misdiagnosed and sent home.

70% of chronic pain sufferers are women, yet 80% of pain studies are conducted on men.

Vita seeks to change this by providing an inclusive, evidence-based environment for women to track, understand, and discuss their health in ways that truly reflect them.

ðŸ§  Key Features

Community Support: A safe social space for users to share experiences, advice, and encouragement.

ðŸ§¬ Research Foundation

Vita draws inspiration from leading studies and advocacy work in the gender health gap:

Medical Research Foundation â€“ Closing the Sex and Gender Gap in Medical Research (Dr Alison Simmons)
Highlights how most studies default to male models, resulting in skewed data and misdiagnosis. Vita bridges this gap by connecting users with real-world, tailored information before academia fully catches up.

Fawcett Society â€“ The Gender Health Gap, Our Stories (Zaimla Azad & Freya Barnes)
Explores lived experiences of women facing diagnostic delays, workplace challenges, and dismissal in care. Vita provides structured, cultural change through open, transparent health dialogue.
